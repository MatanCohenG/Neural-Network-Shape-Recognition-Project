# Neural-Network-Shape-Recognition-Project
This project focuses on the problem of geometric shape recognition using neural networks. Specifically, we are tasked with identifying three shapes: triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. The goal is to train neural networks to accurately classify these shapes under varying conditions of size and position within a 10x10 matrix.
